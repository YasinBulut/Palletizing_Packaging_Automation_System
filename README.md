In my project titled "Palletizing and Packaging Automation System," conducted within the scope of the Mechatronics Engineering Department at Karab√ºk University,
 there are processes such as sorting products by their colors, a lid-product assembly system, palletizing boxes, and storage operations.

Simultaneously, I have developed a desktop application programmed in C# and MSSQL to facilitate easier communication between units in factories.
Software used: Siemens Tia Portal, Eplan, C#, MSSQL
